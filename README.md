# Cyclistic Case Study – Google Data Analytics Capstone

This is my final capstone project for the [Google Data Analytics Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-data-analytics).

## 🧩 Project Objective

Analyze historical trip data from Cyclistic, a bike-share program in Chicago, to understand how casual riders and annual members use the service differently, and provide data-driven marketing recommendations.

## 📊 Tools Used
- R
- Tidyverse
- Lubridate
- ggplot2
- RMarkdown

## 🔍 Key Findings
- Casual users ride more on weekends and take longer trips.
- Members ride more during weekdays and have shorter, frequent trips.
- Personalized marketing strategies can help convert casual users into subscribers.

## 📁 Files
